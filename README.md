# Monty Bytecode Interpreter
by Team Eche and Nick (Cohort 22) Holberton School Australia, Melbourne

This is a simple interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files developed as part of the curriculum at Holberton School.

This is created with C (programming language) and vim (code editor).

## Installation
To run this project, install it locally by cloning our repository using the command ```git clone``` as shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/haoningng/holbertonschool-monty
```

## Usage

### Compiling using Makefile

Our repository contains a _makefile_, and with file it allows you to compile all of the c files in the repo with simple command ```make``` and when you do this it will create an executable called ```./monty```.

Here are some useful commands:

* ```make```: Compile the Monty bytecode interpreter
* ```make clean```: Remove object files

### How it works:

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python).
It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.
There is not more than one instruction per line.
There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument. 

When you run ```./monty file``` , where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code:

```
$ cat -e bytecodes/00.m
push 1$
push 2$
push 3$
pall$
$ ./monty bytecodes/00.m
3
2
1
```

Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

```
$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$
```

### Operator Instruction

These are the intructions (i.e. opcodes) that are recognised by this interpreter.

| **Opcodes** | **Description**|
|----------|----------------|
|`push`| pushes an element to the stack |
|`pall`| prints all the values on the stack, starting from the top of the stack |
|`pint`| prints the value at the top of the stack, followed by a new line |
|`pop`| removes the top element of the stack |
|`swap`| swaps the top two elements of the stack |
|`add`| adds the top two elements of the stack |
|`nop`| doesnâ€™t do anything |
